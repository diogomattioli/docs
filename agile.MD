## Acceptance Criteria
### Update Configuration Remotely via Event-Driven

| No. | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                          |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.  | The embedded system should receive configuration update requests from the backend.                      |
| 2.  | Configuration updates should be initiated by an event from the backend, like an API call or a message.   |
| 3.  | Secure and efficient communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS or MQTT) should be used for updates.          |
| 4.  | Only authorized users/systems should trigger updates using authentication tokens or keys.             |
| 5.  | Configuration data must adhere to a specified format or schema understood by the embedded system.      |
| 6.  | Received configuration updates should be processed and applied by the embedded system.                 |
| 7.  | Proper error handling should manage cases of invalid or incomplete configuration data.                |
| 8.  | Configuration data should be validated for correctness and coherence before application.                |
| 9.  | Configuration updates should be compatible with the current embedded software version.                 |
| 10. | A mechanism should allow reverting to the previous configuration in case of issues or failures.       |
| 11. | Events related to configuration updates, successful or erroneous, should be logged.                    |
| 12. | Peripheral interactions should be managed appropriately if updated configurations affect peripherals.   |
| 13. | Test cases must cover successful updates, invalid data, network disruptions, and rollback scenarios.   |
| 14. | Detailed documentation should outline the event-driven update process, authentication, and errors.    |
| 15. | Evaluate the impact of updates on system performance to ensure no disruptions during normal operation. |
